      <description>With the default configuration, a zone transfer from a master to a slave of BIND with split horizon has the slave transfer only the view of that zone that is available to its IP address. The documentation is a bit vague on the subject, but it turns out it is possible for the slave to transfer the zone definitions corresponding to all (or a subset) of the views.
The idea is to identify the slave for zone transfer purposes using something else that its IP address.</description>
