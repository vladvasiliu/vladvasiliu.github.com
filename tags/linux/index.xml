      <description>Background At work we have to large TV screens used for displaying Grafana dashboards. They are both connected to the same PC.
The PC was running Windows so anytime the PC would reboot, we would have to manually conenct to it via VNC and move the browsers around and set them in full screen mode.
As we are in the office only during work hours, the PC would be shut down and restarted everyday.</description>
