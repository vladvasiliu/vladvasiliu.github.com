      <description>Some hosting providers, like Online in France provide IPv6 access via prefix delegation. You get a DUID that has to be sent to their DHCP server. The IP address is configured by the client.
The recommended method is using Dibbler, but this solution is pretty buggy.
On Ubuntu or Debian, you can use the provided dhclient to obtain the prefix delegation.
Below are samples of dhclient6.conf and interfaces. Note that in this configuration everything is configured by the client, but you could request a name server from the DHCP server.</description>

      <description>If your Linux box gets its IPv6 routing information via router advertisments, you may have noticed that upon enabling forwarding, it disregards those advertisments and it loses the configured gateways.
The have this configuration working again, set accept_ra 2 in /etc/network/interfaces. This value is not documented in the interfaces manual, but since kernel version 2.6.37 it allows the interface to both do forwarding and accept router advertisments.
